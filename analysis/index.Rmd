## **Welcome to my Master's thesis webpage!** ðŸ˜€

Hi! This is an anonymized version of the original website I created to complement and summarize the final project of my Master's in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics of Universitat Oberta de Catalunya: ***"Implementation of a bioinformatics pipeline for the analysis of spatial transcriptomics data"*****.**   

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main goal of my project was to construct a well documented and reproducible pipeline for the analysis of spatial transcriptomic data, specifically from the CosMxâ„¢ SMI technology by NanostringÂ® Technologies.

This website, and its corresponding GitHub repository, serves the purpose of transparently sharing all the code and results of my work. Here you will find:

1.  [CosMxâ„¢ SMI Data Analysis Pipeline](pipeline.html)

2.  [Examples of different normalization methods](norm_examples.html)

3.  [Examples of different cell typing methods](clus_examples.html)

Hopefully, soon my thesis document will be available too, as reference for a more profound insight on my work. For now, I hope what you find here is useful and interesting!
